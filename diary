Created googledocs branch to work with googlesheets. Idea is to load races on to website
Installed:
oauth2client
gspread

changed the spreadsheets.py file scope to include ../auth/drive:
scope = ['https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds',
         'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']

successfully updated spreadsheet using sheet.update_cell(11,13,"test") This puts test in row 11 column 13

Re-familiarising myself with project.Minor changes.
24 October 2018
Installed on PC
Added drop down list in race terrain field.
todo: add further restrictions e.g. to gender, distance units
14 October 2018
See Todo : think about the model and links between race/ruunner and consider fields for distance
Created templates with simple index.html.
Problem: database tables not created.
Next step : create tables somehow
Update: problem was I needed to specify 'runningsteve' folder (app) that had the models.py
e.g. python manage.py makemigrations runningsteve
Now adding data but need to make it work the way I like.

Installed on laptop
12 October 2018
Created models, views, urls, etc.
Merged all into the main runningsteve folder rather than separate ones because I don't know how to have a basic home page!
