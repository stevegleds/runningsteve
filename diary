24 October 2018
Installed on PC
Added drop down list in race terrain field.
todo: add further restrictions e.g. to gender, distance units

See Todo : think about the model and links between race/ruunner and consider fields for distance
Created templates with simple index.html.
Problem: database tables not created.
Next step : create tables somehow
Update: problem was I needed to specify 'runningsteve' folder (app) that had the models.py
e.g. python manage.py makemigrations runningsteve
Now adding data but need to make it work the way I like.

Merged all into the main runningsteve folder rather than separate ones because I don't know how to have a basic home page!
