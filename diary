See Todo : think about the model and links between race/ruunner and consider fields for distance
Created templates with simple index.html.
Problem: database tables not created.
Next step : create tables somehow
Update: problem was I needed to specify 'runningsteve' folder (app) that had the models.py
e.g. python manage.py makemigrations runningsteve
Now adding data but need to make it work the way I like.

Installed on laptop

Created models, views, urls, etc.
Merged all into the main runningsteve folder rather than separate ones because I don't know how to have a basic home page!
